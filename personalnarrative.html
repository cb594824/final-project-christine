Hello, my name is Christine Boylan and this is my personal website! As my final project for Web Design and Development, I created a cooking website in order to convey my love for cooking as well as fulfill the requirements for class. Within the contents of my website, I include a homepage and four pages with delicious recipes. I decided to create a cooking website because I understand how difficult it can be to find time to prepare food, or even come up with the idea of what to have for dinner. By creating a cooking guide for college students, I hope to at least instill inspiration for new recipes and get more students in the kitchen!

My website includes a homepage. On my homepage, I included the links for each of the other pages. These pages include recipes 1, 2, 3 and 4. My recipes include “Stuffed Peppers”, “Fresh Fruit Smoothie”, “Tortellini Soup”, and “Healthy Resees Cups”.

To begin, I added the basic HTML which includes the doctype, meta, title, and body. From there, I began to create my first page, which is the homepage. To be safe, I started by adding a title; “An Intro to Cooking: College Edition”. After adding the title, I used my knowledge of bootstrap to create tabs for each of my other pages. After adding the initial bootstrap link, utilizing the bootstrap link from font-awesome, I was able to search the website to find the individual code for tabs. I selected the tabs, which, I thought were the most appealing. After that, I copied and pasted the link for tabs into each of my five pages. I then proceeded to link my pages together through the tabs. In order to do think I used the html code for a link. After creating the links for each of my five pages, and placing them on my homepage, I inserted them into my other four pages to make sure they would each correlate to one another. Now that my tabs are in place, the reader can navigate from one page to another with ease.

After instilling tabs on my webpage, I added a picture of myself onto my homepage. Because I do not exactly want a picture of myself taking over my entire website, I floated my picture to the far left in my style.css page. After that, I added a short blurb about who I am and went into my style.css page again to make it float underneath my picture.

So far, my website is pretty basic, but that’s not all! I added a brief paragraph to my opening page, which, gives you a bright and appealing opener to the website. Through the use of boarders and background colors, I made my opening paragraph stick out to my readers; this way, the readers are directed towards the specific paragraph and have a clear understanding of what my website is about.

After adding the initial opening paragraph, I created another paragraph that gives a little more info, yet does not jump right off the page. After creating the paragraphs before, I felt the right side of the website was a little bit uneven and I needed to add more.

I also utilized font-awesome, to include a link to my Facebook page. After adding the page, I used font-awesome to display the Facebook logo/tab on the bottom of my page, underneath my name.

In order to float each individual object to the left, right or bottom of my page, I took advantage of my CSS page and divs/classes. I ran into trouble, at first, when I was trying to figure out how to align my picture with a short blurb, which included my name and a bit about me. However, I was able to play around with my CSS page and eventually was able to figure it out. After completing my website, I found that I did not run into too much trouble. The biggest issue was trying to gather all of my text and make them the same font. Although I had written the font-style the same I my CSS page, the actual font was not appearing the same. In the end, I had realized a typing error on my own part; I had not included a letter in one of my divs and therefore was throwing off my style page.

Each of my recipes has a similar, if not identical, format to my homepage. I figured, because I am new to web design, I wanted to keep my website nice and clean. It seemed easier for my readers, but it was also easier for my to read and understand as I was creating it.

In order to customize my website, I used the CSS color picker and chose colors that I thought were contrasting and easy to read. I inserted the hexadecimal into the appropriate CSS positions. After applying my background and font colors, I downloaded a background pattern from subtle fonts. After my background downloaded, I placed it in my images folder in my final project portfolio folder. Here, I ran into another issue but soon realized that my background pattern was not saved as a JPEG and therefore would not work. After changing it to a JPEG file, I was able to insert it into Brackets.

Overall, I learned a lot from creating my final project portfolio. Before taking web design and development, I did not know anything about CSS or HTML. I had actually thought they were basically interchangeable. After completing this project, I have come to understand the differences and I am now very familiar with bootstrap as well. The tools that I have learned will be very helpful for me in the future, especially, considering the fact that I will be graduating in May.
